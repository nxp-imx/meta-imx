Quick Start Guide
-----------------
First install the i.MX Freescale BSP repo
$: repo init -u git://git.freescale.com/imx/fsl-arm-yocto-bsp.git -b imx-3.10.17-1.0.0_ga

Download the Yocto Freescale Layers
$: repo sync

Copy the new machine configuration files from meta-fsl-bsp-release into meta-fsl-arm
This is required for community setup to find the new machine configurations provided in 3.10.17-1.0.0

$: cp -r sources/meta-fsl-bsp-release/imx/meta-fsl-arm/conf/machine sources/meta-fsl-arm/conf


Run i.MX Yocto Project Setup
$: MACHINE=< machine name> source fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e <backend fb, dfb, wayland, x11>

This will sync in the layer and update local.conf and bblayer.conf in build directory.

After this step, you will have everything to build an image.


Build Configurations
---------------------
Freescale has created new images to support multiple graphics back ends.  
Below is the setup for all the backends with the new image recipes.

Note that <build directory> is the same directory specified in the setup-environment.  If not specified it is a
directory called "build".

Building X11
------------
X11 is default so existing community will work using existing images.    
$: bitbake fsl-image-x11

Building Frame Buffer (FB)
---------------------------
Frame buffer requires a DISTRO_FEATURES change which our setup script will provide in local.conf
fsl-image-fb provides the frame buffer image.  Note that since gpu-viv-bin-mx6q provides 
different binaries for each backend, it is recommended to build a clean system to pick up the right gpu frame buffer libraries.

$: MACHINE=<machine name>. ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e fb
$: bitbake fsl-image-fb

Building Direct FB (DFB)
---------------------------
Direct FB requires a DISTRO_FEATURES change which our setup script will provide in local.conf
fsl-image-dfb provides the direct frame buffer image.  Note that since gpu-viv-bin-mx6q provides 
different binaries for each backend, it is recommended to build a clean system to pick up the right gpu directfb libraries.

$: MACHINE=<machine name>. ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e dfb
$: bitbake fsl-image-dfb

Building Wayland-Weston (wayland)
---------------------------
Wayland Weston requires a DISTRO_FEATURES change which our setup script will provide in local.conf
fsl-image-wayland provides the wayland weston image.  Note that since gpu-viv-bin-mx6q provides
different binaries for each backend, it is recommended to build a clean system to pick up the right gpu frame buffer libraries.

$: MACHINE=<machine name>. ./fsl-setup-release.sh -b <build directory> -e wayland
$: bitbake fsl-image-weston


Hardware Floating Point
-----------------------
This release enables hardware floating point.  This feature is enabled in both the machine 
configurations and in the layer.conf (because some machine files exist in community meta-fsl-arm.
DEFAULTTUNE_mx6 = "cortexa9hf-neon

To build as softare floating point add the following to local.conf
DEFAULTTUNE_mx6 = "cortexa9-neon"

Note we also provide some binaries with a software floating point version which we switch basis on FP_TAG in layer.conf.
This release was only tested for hardware floating point.

Restricted Codecs
-----------------
Some codecs have recipes in the layer but binaries are not provided in the Yocto fetch system (microsoft, ac3 and aacp)
These codecs have contractual restrictions that require separate distribution.

Manufacturing Tool
------------------
The manufacturing tool image is provided in the 3.10.17-1.0.0 release.  This includes the fsl-image-manufacturing that is used
to flash the target device.  

End User License Agreement
--------------------------
During the Freescale Yocto Community BSP setup-environment process, the Freescale i.MX End User License Agreement (EULA) 
is displayed. To continue, users must agree to the conditions of this license. The agreement to the terms allows the 
Yocto build to untar packages from the Freescale mirror. Please read this license agreement carefully during the 
setup process because, once accepted, all further work in the Yocto environment is tied to this accepted agreement.

Chromium
---------
The Chromium browser requires additional layers added in the fsl-release-setup.sh script.   
To enable chromium requires the following steps

In local.conf 
- Add in chromium into your list
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "chromium"

- Add the commercial white list into local.conf. 
LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST="commercial"

- To enable rendering of WebGL do the following steps after boot.  Add the following lines to  /etc/profile or /usr/bin/google-chrome
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libGAL.so:/usr/lib/libEGL.so:/usr/lib/libGLSLC.so:/usr/lib/libCLC.so:/usr/lib/libGLESv2.so

- Start the Chromium browser
$google-chrome --use-gl=egl 

QTWebkit
--------
To start go to /usr/share/qt5/examples/webkitwidgets/browser and run browser


QT5
---
Two image recipes are provided
fsl-image-gui is a non QT5 recipe that works on all backends - x11, directfb, frame buffer and wayland
fsl-image-qt5 is a QT5 image recipe that works on x11, frame buffer and wayland.
